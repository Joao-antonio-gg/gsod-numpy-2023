## New Topics
-  Update on **Writing Script, Thumbnailing stage** for GSOD-NumPy 2023
    -  [Link to script draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AzK9Q1vCPjcK6j9pMQTOm6K-zMiZf5FU/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110556856523158639329&rtpof=true&sd=true)
    - **Next steps**
        -  At this stage, will work closely with project mentors Mukulika and Ross
        -  Once script is cleaned up (pages, dialogue), will open for Review #2 with wider community
    -  **Major changes to script:**
        - Focus on grad students and Open Science
        -  Removal of Professor character
            -  provide distance from purely academic setting
            -  remove clear authority figure that provides solution and approval
            -  shift to students to muck around and find out themselves what to do next
        -  Add different POVs, from the PR Maker and Maintainer Characters
            -  show different people do different things
            -  show different priorities eg maintainer thinks about release cycle, students in story don't know anything about release cycles
        -  Shift scope from 'big picture contribution pathways' to 'characters entering open source'
            -  Started project with keen interest in mapping culture of open source, questions that community members engage in such as ‘How do we turn first time contributors to second time contributors?’ and ‘How do we encourage tagging issues or documentation as equal ways to contribute?’
            -  However, these questions may not be engaging to people not already in the community
            -  Expands potential audience, everyone can relate to a human struggle vs debates on niche topic

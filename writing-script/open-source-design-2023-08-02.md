Hi all! I’ve joined this month’s call to give a quick update on Open Source Comics!

I’ve working on a grant with NumPy and Google Seasons of Docs to create the ‘NumPy Contributor Comics’! It uses comics as a form of visual documentation, which aims to be more engaging to newcomers.

Here are some links I shared:

2. [Github repo with artifacts such as concept art, scripts and community meeting notes.](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023)

# Script Draft #1
Overall message: NumPy is driven by people who use it: scientists!
3 stooges energy

## Opening scene
Characters in library, opening shot to library (University of Monty), student settling down to table
Chat about previous class, mention professor, really advocate for NumPy
Opening laptop, let's take a look at Cell imaging data, single cell microscope data stored as numpy arrays
Hey man, why we got todo this early, we got time
## Rising Action: Discover the problem
 Terminal
         - Tools and visuals; data = np.load, achive npz
            - NPZ archive, why wonâ€™t it work like a dictionary?
            - Named arrays inside archive, couldn't find out where the names where, the docs have a files attribute that tells you the name, why can't you see the names as is, a usability shortcoming
Bunch of students  download this dataset, why can't I tell
       - next line, I know this archive contains arrays but how do I access them? What are the arays caled
## Rising Action: Confusion, Deciding Next Steps, Disagreement
        - How familiar are the students with Github? Showing the entire journey, looking up numpy
Hey I've never used Github before, Oh I have an account but only uploaded my code, not repo, I've made forks but not contributed
Hmm how do we go about doing this? Is it even worth it?
Hmm I don't really want to do the work, let's send this off! We got time, after all
I mean, our professor likes NumPy, i'm sure he would say this is relevant haha
## Taking Action
        - In story: Have Github, but never made an issue before
        - Look up NumPy.com, show scrolling experience, keyword extraction, huh! Oh! What?
        - Zoom in making a issue
    - Make issue show steps, let's use one account
    - Oh gosh, do I really make a issue?
    Go through options, clicking, writing
    One person on Github writing issue, one person open terminal describing issue, last person ???
    OK, submit! Off into the ether!
    Hmm, did anything happen? Well I have notifications open
## Next Action
- late that week: oh someone responded! This also bothers me! Working on it!
- yay! But who is this person? Do we need to do anything? 
- I guess now, diagram of confusion about forking branching, what is this person doing?
= Well, we'll hear about it i guess
- a month later
- A PR that mentionns our issue! 
- Look at ode,,I don't understand a lot, even though we use PYthon it's written C
- one person: I want to understand more sometime!
## Implementation and Resolution
        - At end, show that some actions done by people
        - 1 months later: Students gather again at library, talking about mid terms done
        - Oh, hey, check out this email! 
        - Reply on comments
          -             - Don't get taught version work, deprecation, "Should we expand the API", subjective design, harder to capture
            - Emphasize **Backwards compatibility**, "I wish this function accepted these arguments, unpacked tuples", "We're not likely to accept it, propose it to the mailing list" "Here's the reason why, not because you're idea, we might have wished we designed this way, snapshot to grad students code, if change than breaks"
            - Many people not learn about backwards compatibility formally in school, abosrob via osmoosis, how ties to decision making
        - At ending: 2 months later, new microscope data, that was our idea, version release, 
        - type in file name, says 'cell'! Success! High five!
        - Implementator has Credit in Github history, mailing list release 
        - Let's go on community meeting next week, saw it on the mailing list
        -     - Show forking, making a local copy, branching, making a push
## Credits and Ending Notes
- Credit specific people and actual PRs
- Make QR code for the links?
- Note to new to open source: real story! You could too!
    - Links
        - Issue Ross made: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/23319
        - PR Ganesh implemented: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23357

## Self-review of 1st draft
- Contains the narrative bones
- Some characters interactions
- Lots of cutting forward in somewhat narratively unsatifsying ways- but that's reality isn't it? Wait and see?

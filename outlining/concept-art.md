# Concept Art
- Concept art "used to convey an idea for use in films, video games, animation, comic books, or other media before it is put into the final product... Multiple solutions are explored before settling on the final design." ([Wikipedia article on concept art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_art))

## Users as Fantasy RPGs roles
- Documentation writer as Scribe
- Code contributor as Warrior
- Reviewing and Triaging as Ranger

## Python open-source landscape as a fantasy map
- Main two lands: Open Source Land and across the far sea, Licensed Land
- Users pointing out their hometown, how they got here in NumPy land

## Users interacting with each other
- Users receiving a shared quest eg an issue tagged 'first good issue'
- Users starting on an adventure! But wait, where do we go? What's going on?
- Users reading a map, pointing at different directions
  - "I think we should make a PR!"
  - "We should open an issue and ask for help!"
  = "Let's go a community meeting and introduce ourselves!"

## Importance of different roles
- User pointing a weapon and saying "How do I use this thing?!" and another user reading from the weapon's manual

## Users talking to a maintainer
- Maintainer making suggestions, which is especially useful after users disagreed on how to proceed on map

## Breaking the 4th wall: characters are role-playing
- Not literally a Fantasy character, not a Warrior in NumPy-Land
- Regular people meeting each other a convention about open-source
- Similar to a table-top session
  - a referee or "Dungeon Master" (from Dungeons and Dragons games)
  - Character talking about what they want to do
- "How do I learn Git?"
  - "Oh I think you can go to the sprint later, they'll explain in more detail and a virtual environment."

## Epilogue
- Users continue their journey together and individually

## Build your own character sheets
- A fun way to ask "What is my User Perona?" "What is my Contribution Pathway Goals?" "Where should I start?"

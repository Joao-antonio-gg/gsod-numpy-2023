# Concept Art
- Concept art "used to convey an idea for use in films, video games, animation, comic books, or other media before it is put into the final product... Multiple solutions are explored before settling on the final design." ([Wikipedia article on concept art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_art))

## In this concept art, there are two parts:
- Explaining contributor workflow (direct)
- Using fantasy metaphors (indirect)

## Relationship between these two parts:
- The fantasy metaphor should not hide or overcomplicate the contributor workflow
- Maybe start off with direct metaphor?
- Or as we explore further in project, we choose to remove fantasy metaphor
- Or only occasionally use fantasy metaphor

## Concept Art to Comic Book?
- Due to time or page constraints, may not be able to make flowing story panel to panel
- May end up with more blog styl: informational images with text underneath to explain in more detail
- Tying together seamlessly with story is harder and takes more time

## Python open-source landscape as a fantasy map
- Main two lands: Open Source Land and across the far sea, Licensed Land
- Users pointing out their hometown, how they got here in NumPy land
  - "Oh I came from MatLab lands so I haven't used NumPy much"
  - "I started in Fortan but have been using NumPy for years"

## Users as Fantasy RPGs roles
- Documentation writer as Scribe
- Code contributor as Warrior
- Reviewing and Triaging as Ranger

## Users interacting with each other
- Users receiving a shared quest eg an issue tagged 'good first issue'
  - Shared quest written on a scroll
  
- Users starting on their adventure! But wait, where do we go? What's going on?
  - Starting adventure = Sprint with 'good first issue'
  
- Users huddled around, reading a map, pointing at different directions
  - "I think we should make a PR!"
  - "We should open an issue and ask for help!"
  - "Let's go a community meeting and introduce ourselves!"

- Are these within same context of sprint?
  - In a sprint, there would be a little more guidance and directness
  - "We should make a PR!" vs "How do I set this up locally?" vs "Let's ask the sprint lead"

## Importance of different roles
- User pointing a weapon and saying "How do I use this thing?!" and another user reading from the weapon's manual
  - Weapon: Sword, to fit Warrior = code contributor?
  - A magic staff would be more mysterious

## Users talking to a maintainer
- Maintainer making suggestions, which is especially useful after users disagreed on how to proceed on map
  - "Do you know how to use Git?"
  - "If you're not able to finish this in the sprint, you could continue the work afterwards and check back in a future NumPy community meeting"

## Breaking the 4th wall: characters are role-playing?
- Because not sure if story should live in
  - 1. Our World. Literally NumPy and open source as it is
  - 2. A Fantasy World. NumPy is a magic power and community
  - 3. Our World, but using Fantasy World as framing device. eg playing roles in Dungeons and Dragons (DnD)
- Not literally a Fantasy character, not a Warrior in NumPy-Land?
- Regular people meeting each other a convention about open-source
- Similar to a table-top session
  - a referee or "Dungeon Master" (from Dungeons and Dragons games)
  - Character talking about what they want to do
- "How do I learn Git?"
  - "Oh I think you can go to the sprint later, they'll explain in more detail and a virtual environment."

## Epilogue
- Users continue their journey together and individually

## Build your own character sheets
- A fun way to ask "What is my User Persona?" "What is my Contribution Pathway Goals?" "Where should I start?"

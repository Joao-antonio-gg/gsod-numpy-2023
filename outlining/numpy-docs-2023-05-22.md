    - [Summary from Brainstorming Sessions](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/outlining/summary-from-brainstorming-sessions.md)
    - Next steps
        - Narrow down [User Personas](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/outlining/user-persona-contributor-pathways.md)
        - Draw [Concept Art Prompts](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/outlining/concept-art.md)
    - Discussion points
        - Use of metaphor: to make a complicated topic friendly
        - Metaphor should not core topic (contributor workflow) make more complicated
        - User Persona: Could get input eg Twitter
            - Getting more user input would be best practice: but may not fit in timeline
            - Could do later, perhaps future review stage
    - Review stage
        - on NumPy github issues through mailing list, slack and community meeting channels.
        - Using Google Docs, since easier to comment on images than on Github PR
        - Reviews stage open for 2 weeks (late May-early June)
    - Letting go making full 'comic book style'
        - Due to time constraints, may not be able to make full flowing story panel to panel
        - May end up with blog style: informational images with text underneath to explain in more detail
        - Similar to [prototype](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*kwkvHzegb0z4TzeHsuF_GQ.png)
        - Less similar to [SciPy comics](https://heyzine.com/flip-book/f3c7f85cdc.html)
        - Especially since contributor workflow has several different scopes
            - Zoomed in scope, eg people working together during a sprint
            - Zoomed out scope, eg role of maintainers or community members  
            - Several different characters: contributor workflow would probably need at least... 6 characters? Hard to sustain coherent script for 6 characters
        - Letting go of artist ego to fully utilize 'comic book' medium
        - Need to realistically rescope to fit in other important factors eg gathering community input, representing a relatively complex topic (contributor workflow)
        - Working more as a documentary movie rather than cinematic story-driven movie
            - The value is more in documenting processes and people rather than thrilling story or camera angles
    - Recognizing desire for print version is contributor factor to wanting a 'full comic experience'
        - Paper version needs to fit rectangular size, hence use of panels
        - Digital version can be any size, but we can keep to rectangular size
        - Digital version reach wider audience, especially outside conferences in North America

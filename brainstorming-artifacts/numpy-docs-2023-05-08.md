## New Topics
- Gathering community input for GSOD-NumPy 2023 with a 10 minute Brainstorming Session
    - [Link to Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1j_rEIslOh59N9cLGU1VGc7rTc88SuLTi7l4YqTqAULc/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Main questions
        - What comments or concerns do you have about this project?
        - Based on your role in NumPy, what would your fantasy class be?
    - Can leave your comments on Jamboard after meeting as well
    - Discussion points
        - Incomplete metaphor: How well does the fantasy RPG model match the contribution model?
        - In fantasy RPG, role -> experience. In contribution, gain experience -> maybe gain role
        - Move to Role-based -> Experience based. Use badges or tags instead of RPG class?
        - Inherent difficulty in quantifying what cannot be easily quantified
        - Concern: Quantifying without nuance might turn contribution into a competition
        - Hesitation to call code contributor warriors. Maybe fits in RPG context but not in building software?
        - Is there another metaphor that could work? eg building houses? camping?
        - Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) was given as a metaphor. But DnD is very western-centric, may be unfamiliar to some audiences

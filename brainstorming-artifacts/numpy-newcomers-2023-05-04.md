    - Feedback on User Profiles
        - "Migrating users", moving from Fortran or Julia or R to Python
        - When someone would use Fortran vs NumPy, especially for heavy computation
        - When someone would use Julia, especially useful in specific financial uses
        - Non-linear paths contributors can take
        - Learning to contribute to NumPy has it's own specifications different from other projects eg NumPy naming conventions

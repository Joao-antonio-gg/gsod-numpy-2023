## Outline
Hi everyone! My item on the agenda is the brainstorming for the GSOD-NumPy project.
- I will first go through some slides on this Google Jamboard and then open for questions and brainstorming ideas at the end.
- The shortest amount of time this will take is 10 minutes. If people are interested and there's more discussion, it could extend for a bit.
- Here's a link to the brainstorming document:

Now we come to the question and brainstorming section. My first question is
- What comments or concerns do you have about this project?

With Google Jamboards, you can write your comment, move it around or even draw. Since I'm sharing my screen, I can transcribe for us, but feel free to open the Jamboard on your own device and write by yourself.

The second question is a bit sillier but still relevant:
- Based on your role in NumPy, what would your fantasy class be?

Thanks everyone for partcipating! I will upload this Jamboard into the project repository. at https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/tree/main/brainstorming-artifacts.

The next brainstorming session will be the NumPy Community Meeting this Wednesday, May 10.

## New Topics
- **Review #1 stage** for GSOD-NumPy 2023
    - Will share on this community call and make Github issue to open to wider community who may not be in call
    - Also shared in NumPy Docs meeting earlier this wek
    - Drew some Concept Art
        - 1. How do you use NumPy?

        - 2. How did you start using NumPy? ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByOca3TDh.jpg)
        - 3. How do we start a sprint? ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByHip36Dh.jpg)
        - [Link to full Concept Art prompts](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/outlining/concept-art.md)
    - Discussion points
        - Writing out specific parts I would like feedback on 
            - **Is there an issue that was actually completed during a sprint, that can be used in the comics?**
                - Currently taken from random issue tagged as 'sprintable' https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22435
            - **Metaphor**: Making digital pages into physical media (Github issues as paper scrolls)
            - **Characters**: over-confident, under-confident and just right
                - Over-confident: "I bet I already know how to do this!"
                - Under-confident: "Can I start working on this issue?""
                - Just right: "Let's review the documentation if this already exists and if I'm still not sure, I'll ask someone."
    - Next steps
        - Putting together review: Github issue
            - 3 main drawings, as shown above
            - [Chapters](https://github.com/MarsBarLee/gsod-numpy-2023/blob/main/outlining/chapters.md)
                - Introduction
                    - To characters and how in-person sprints work
                - The sprint itself
                    - Collaboration and the importance of different approaches
                - After the sprint
                    - Meeting remotely, connecting to mailing  list and Slack
                - Goals and future
                    - Contributor's goals, how open source processes are open to change too
        - Annoucing that open for review: mailing list and Slack channel
            - 2 weeks period for getting reviews?
            - But I think most comments will come from community meetings
            - For Review stage #2, want to coordinate so people know they can join community calls to give reviews
    - Comments from this call:
        - Different levels of problem, of 'sprintable'
        - Emphasize following-up after the sprint
        - It's normal it won't be done in one sprint
        - De-emphasize the onramp of sprinting becasue fly-bys
        - Focus on user-contributor, most likely to follow through, sustainable commmunity growth
        - There's a specific example Ross has about loading data, NPZ archive, why won't it work like a dictionary?
        - Ross opened issue
        - Ganesh wrote implementation, Sebastian and Ross review
        - NumPy is driven by people who use it
        - Maybe start with a character in classroom (meteorology thesis character)
        - NPZ as 20 year old, not brought up until by users
        - Instead of sprint leader, maybe Professor character guiding students
        - Maybe interview, get links to PRs and issues, get narrative flow
        - Sprints as not primary onboarding mechanism, people who make larger contributions come through other channels, driven by scientific research
        - Mars will follow-up with Ross
        - Similar examples: AstroPy
        - We serve everybody who lives on top of NumPy
        - Can check against user surveys how people use NumPy
        - Maybe add sprint to end, not be center of conversation
        - Can talk to a new contributor to NumPy, a maintainer of SciPy but newcomer to NumPy (talk to Melissa)
    - Previous steps in GSOD-NumPy 2023:
        - Completed Outlining stage for GSOD-NumPy 2023 (May 15-26)
        - Completed Gathering community input stage and 3 brainstorming sesions
            - At Newcomer(May 4) NumPy Docs (May 8), Commmunity (May 10)

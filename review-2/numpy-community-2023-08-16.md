## New Topics
- Community Review #2 for GSOD-NumPy 2023
    - **The script can be viewed here, as a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110556856523158639329&rtpof=true&sd=true)**. You can comment either here on [Github](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/24382) or on the Google Doc, whichever you prefer.
    - Both will be open for 2 weeks and close **Aug 23**.
    - For review, you can comment on any part, whether you like the idea of the comics, don't like a specific line or not sure what something means.
    - Themes: **NumPy is made by the people who use it: scientists**! Thus a group of grad students learn how to contribute to NumPy by creating an issue for a usability problem. By talking to community members, a PR is made to change the .npz file beheavior.
    - Some specific parts I would like feedback on:
        - **Themes**
          - [On Page 5, ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit?disco=AAAA3sVZK9Y)does this panel accurately show the tie between open source and open science?
        - **Story and Pacing**
          - Does this seem like a reasonable amount of content to cover in 16 pages?
          - Do the three students interacting together feel realistic?
            - eg Since they're beginners, they don't at answer immediately
            - eg not too mean-spirited? They argue, to show different approaches
        - **Accuracy**
          - [On Page 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit?disco=AAAA3sVZK9c), how accurate is the .npz code?
          - [On Page 7](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fjLTDqSkcKMxo8oSTRThllBFpjo5rXS9/edit?disco=AAAA3sVZK9k), does the visual metaphor of the NumPy issue tracker as a bulletin board make sense?
  - Feedback from the crowd: quite positive, folks are happy, the story flows well, and the scope is right.
  - Ross will have a much closer look again soon.
  - Can it be part of the docs page?
      - Depends on size of images. Probably circle back after completion
